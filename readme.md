## Features
* 3d rendering library which support configurable model / geometry / texture / mateiral real-time rendering with
lighting and other shading effect. A personal project for computer graphic exploration and study refer to OGRE, Three.js, UE4.
* Integrated with OpenGL graphic API / GLSL shader and developing unified rendering hardware interface(RHI).
*  RHI will support with self CPU-based SoftRd Rendering. pipeline (refer to OpenGL implementation. Developed rasterization, vertex/fragment shader, mesh importer and basic geometric math library) in the fulture.
* Native desktop GUI implementation with ImGUI. Experimental web integration using React, WASM, Electron, N-API in softrd (http://softrdweb-env.eba-ebkfh2wp.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
